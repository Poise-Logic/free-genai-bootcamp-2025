            - BAD: The vocabulary table is incomplete; key words such as "to let know" and "to call someone" are missing.
            - BAD: The sentence structure is too vague and does not reflect proper Spanish word order.
            - BAD: The "Clues and Considerations" section includes Spanish words, which the student should be retrieving from the vocabulary table instead.
            - BAD: The hints give away conjugations instead of guiding the student to figure them out.

            Here's a vocabulary list to help you construct your sentence:

            | Spanish | English | Notes |
            |---------|---------|-------|
            | querer | to want | Common verb |
            | saber | to know | Regular verb |
            | por qué | why | Question word |
            | tarde | late | Adjective |
            | casa | home | Noun |
            | pero | but | Conjunction |
            | llamar | to call | Regular verb |
            | dejar | to let | Often used with "to let know" |

            Sentence Structure:  
            [Subject] [Verb] [Reason] [but] [Subject] [Verb] [Reason]

            Clues and Considerations:
            - Use "quiero" for "I want."
            - "Why you are home late" should be "por qué estás en casa tarde."
            - "Didn’t call" should be conjugated in the preterite tense.
            - The phrase "to let me know" can be translated as "hacerme saber."

            - GOOD: The vocabulary table includes all necessary words and relevant prepositions.
            - GOOD: The sentence structure section correctly reflects Spanish word order and indirect question formation.
            - GOOD: The "Clues and Considerations" section does not include any Spanish words, prompting the student to use the vocabulary table.
            - GOOD: The hints guide the student to figure out conjugations and grammar rules rather than providing answers outright.

            Vocabulary Table:

            | Spanish | English | Notes |
            |---------|---------|-------|
            | querer | to want | Common verb |
            | saber | to know | Used for factual knowledge |
            | por qué | why | Used in indirect questions |
            | porque | because | Different from "por qué" |
            | tarde | late | Adverb |
            | a casa | home | Used when referring to movement |
            | pero | but | Conjunction |
            | llamar a alguien | to call someone | Requires "a" before a person |
            | avisar | to let (someone) know | More natural than "dejar" |

            Sentence Structure:
            [Negation] [Subject] [Verb] [to know] [Why] [Subject] [Verb] [Complement],
            [but] [Subject] [Verb] [to know] [Why] [Subject] [Did not Verb] [Complement].

            Clues and Considerations:
            - The first verb means "to want" and should be followed by another verb in its base form.
            - The phrase "why you are home late" is an indirect question, meaning the word order should not change from a statement.
            - In Spanish, negative words generally come before the verb. Think about how this affects "didn’t call."
            - To express "let me know," Spanish uses a verb meaning "to inform" or "to notify." Which word in the vocabulary table fits best?
