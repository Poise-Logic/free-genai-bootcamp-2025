## ChatGPT Powered Assistant Guide

### Which Model

GPT-4o mini

> I do have access to the free version of ChatGPT which includes full access to GPT-4o mini and limited access to o3-mini. The goal is to use what I have to develop a working proof of concept.
>
> Due to the free tier constraints, I plan on using the o3-mini for prompt refinement when necessary, and GPT-4o mini for testing the refined prompts (which are then tweaked based on inconsistencies till we have the final prompt) and proof of concept.
>
> o3-mini has stronger reasoning abilities than GPT-4o mini, making it useful when iterating on our prompt to ensure clarity, structure, and effectiveness.
>
> Since GPT-4o Mini is the most powerful model available to me on the free tier, refining prompts on o3-mini and executing them on GPT-4o mini makes sense. 
>
> 4o-mini is weaker than GPT-4 but still better than GPT-3.5, and for structured guidance tasks (like tutoring), it should still perform decently.
>
> Known Limitations: GPT-4o ini isnâ€™t as powerful as full GPT-4o (paid tier). It might handle complex sentence structures, nuanced grammar, or idiomatic expressions slightly worse than the full GPT-4 model.
>
> Overall, I'm curious as to how well the free version will perform before upgrading to GPT-4.


## Prompting Guide

Based on OpenAI's documentation, It appears ChatGPT doesn't have any special prompting requirements to best understand context like other models.
