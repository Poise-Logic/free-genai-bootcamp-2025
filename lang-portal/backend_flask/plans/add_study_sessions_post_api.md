# Implementation Plan: POST /api/study_sessions Endpoint

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the POST `/api/study_sessions` endpoint, which will create a new study session in the database.

## Requirements from Technical Specs
- Endpoint: POST `/api/study_sessions`
- Required Parameters:
  - `group_id` (integer): ID of the group associated with the study session
  - `study_activity_id` (integer): ID of the study activity for this session
- Response: JSON object containing the created study session details

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Implement the POST route handler in `study_sessions.py`
```
Add a new POST route handler to the study_sessions.py file that:
1. Accepts POST requests to /api/study_sessions
2. Validates that both group_id and study_activity_id are provided in the request
3. Creates a new study session record in the database
4. Returns a JSON response with the created study session details
```

### Task 2: Validate input parameters
```
Implement validation for the input parameters:
1. Ensure group_id and study_activity_id are present in the request
2. Verify that group_id corresponds to an existing group
3. Verify that study_activity_id corresponds to an existing study activity
4. Return appropriate error responses if validation fails
```

### Task 3: Database interaction
```
Implement the database operations to:
1. Insert a new record into the study_sessions table
2. Set the current timestamp for created_at
3. Retrieve the newly created record ID
4. Handle any potential database errors
```

### Task 4: Format and return the response
```
Format the response according to the API specification:
1. Create a JSON object with a 'study_session' key
2. Include id, group_id, study_activity_id, and created_at in the response
3. Ensure the created_at timestamp is in ISO 8601 format
```

### Task 5: Error handling
```
Implement comprehensive error handling:
1. Handle database errors
2. Handle validation errors
3. Return appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for bad request, 404 for not found, 500 for server error)
4. Include descriptive error messages in the response
```

### Task 6: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support
```
Ensure CORS support is properly configured:
1. Add the @cross_origin() decorator to the route
2. Verify that the appropriate headers are included in the response
```

## Testing Strategy
- Test with valid parameters
- Test with missing parameters
- Test with invalid group_id
- Test with invalid study_activity_id
- Test with various edge cases (e.g., special characters in parameters)

## Integration Points
- Frontend will call this endpoint to create new study sessions
- This endpoint will be used when launching study activities
